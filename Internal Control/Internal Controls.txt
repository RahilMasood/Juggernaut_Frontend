Internal Controls

There are three types of controls:


Things to ask at the time of control creation:
i. Direct/Indirect/GITC
ii. Control ID
iii. Control Name
iv. Workspace to be linked to
v. Once Direct/Indirect/GITC selected to also ask – Manual/Automated

1. Direct Controls
Direct controls are of three types of nature:


i. Manual Controls:
It has 6 attributes:









a. Control Summary
This has three parts:
- Control Details
Control ID (to be entered by user at the time of control creation)
Control Name (to be entered by user at the time of control creation)
Workspace Linked (this has to be all the areas it is linked to)
Control Description (rich text editor)

Tailoring Questions
1. The engagement team is planning to test the operating effectiveness of the control. (Toggle on or off)
2. The control addresses a significant risk. (Toggle on or off)
3. The control includes a review element and addresses a significant accounting estimate. (Toggle on or off)

- Related Accounts and Areas
Every control has to be associated to atleast one RoMM because the point of a control is to mitigate RoMM. So the RoMMs will be displayed here that the control is linked to. The respective RoMMs will have Note Line IDs linked to them, so those note line IDs will also be displayed, basically in the below format:
Note Line ID linked
    RoMM 1 linked
    RoMM 2 linked

- Detailed Description
First the control description entered by the user in Control Summary has to be displayed on the top of this screen.

2. Information used in control (IUC)
Here user should be able to associate any information from information library.

3. Outputs of the control
Understand the output of the control, which includes understanding the specific evidence that supports that the control activity that occurred.
Give option to user to add output. The output will be a rich text editor.

b. Evaluate Design and Determine Implementation

- Have you tested the operating effectiveness of atleast one control for the current year? [Yes/No – if Yes, to give option to user to associate control just like dependency on control section]
Note: if the answer to the above two questions is No and Yes respectively, only then it should be considered valid. If the answer is no, then to display a note saying, “The answers to the questions suggest that prior year audit evidence cannot be used to test the operating effectiveness of controls. Please revisit OE strategy.”

-  For each control for which we are using prior year audit evidence, include a sufficient description of the testing performed (may include copies of previous year working papers) to enable an experienced auditor, having no previous connection with the engagement, to understand the nature, timing, extent and results of the procedures performed, evidence obtained and conclusions reached. [Document]

d. Risk Associated with Control (does not come if tailoring question 1 in control summary is toggled off)

* Whether the account balance, class of transaction or disclosure has a history of errors,
* The effectiveness of entity-level controls, especially controls that monitor other controls,
* The nature of the control and the frequency with which it operates,
* The degree to which the control relies on the effectiveness of other controls
* The competence of the personnel who perform the control or monitor its performance and whether there have been any changes in authority and responsibility,
